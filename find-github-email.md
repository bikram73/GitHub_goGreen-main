# 📧 How to Find Your GitHub Email

## Step 1: Go to GitHub Settings
1. Open your web browser
2. Go to: **https://github.com/settings/emails**
3. Log in to your GitHub account if needed

## Step 2: Find Your Primary Email
Look for your email address on that page. It will show something like:
- ✅ **yourname@gmail.com** (Primary)
- Or whatever email you used to sign up

## Step 3: Copy That Email
Copy the email address exactly as shown.

## Common GitHub Email Examples:
- `john.doe@gmail.com`
- `user123@outlook.com` 
- `developer@yahoo.com`
- `yourname@company.com`

## ⚠️ Important:
- Use the EXACT email from your GitHub settings
- Don't make up an email - it must match your GitHub account
- This is usually the email you used to sign up for GitHub
